      <p>Passwords are annoying. They're hard to create and hard to remember. When we forget them (as
         we all do) we have reset codes sent to our email addresses, which we assume is secure.
         So, if we ultimately rely on the "security" of email anyway, why not just do away with
         passwords altogether and just use email?</p>
      <p>This site is a proof of concept of the no-password idea. In this case, you login or
         register with your email address, then enter a time-limited random security code that
         is sent to that email address. The browser will remember that you're logged in for a long
         while, so you won't need to go through this process very often.</p>
      <p>Not much else about this site is interesting. It's just enough to test whether this
         passwordless approach is workable. For more a lot more discussion about this and other
         no-password schemes, see the <a href="https://github.com/BrentNoorda/NoMorePasswordsJustEmail/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">NoMorePasswordsJustEmail
