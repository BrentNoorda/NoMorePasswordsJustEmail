      <p>Passwords suck. Good, strong passwords are difficult to think up,
         difficult to type,
         and difficult to remember--but all too easy to crack.
         When you forget your password (as we all do), there's the sucky "email me instructions to
         change my password" and then you have to go through that difficult password creation all over again.
         Multiply these difficulties by every service you use (you <i>better not</i> be reusing passwords), and there's
         just no denying it: passwords suck!</p>
      <p><b>This site is a no-password proof of concept.</b> In this case, you login or
         register with your email address, then enter a time-limited random security code that
         is sent to that email address. (In most cases you won't need to do this often, because
         the browser will remember that you're logged in unless you explicitly "logout".)</p>
      <p>There's not much else to talk about here, folks. Mostly the password POC. For more discussion about this and other
         no-password schemes, see <a href="https://github.com/BrentNoorda/NoMorePasswordsJustEmail/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">NoMorePasswordsJustEmail
